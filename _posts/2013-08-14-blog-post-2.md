During my sophomore year, I navigated through intense competition and rigorous selection processes to become a member of the Robotic Motion and Vision Laboratory, embarking on a journey of research. Within this esteemed laboratory, I honed foundational research skills and actively engaged in various projects, notably the Multi-robot Swarm Control. This particular project was a collaborative endeavor with [movLab](https://www.amovlab.com/), yielding valuable experiences and insights.
